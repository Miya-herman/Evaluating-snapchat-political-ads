# Evaluating-snapchat-political-ads
Mini Project #2

Dataset Background: The data set I chose was the 2020 snapchat political advertisements library. I chose to analyze this data because I was interested in how political campaigns target my age demographic, and how different factors contirubted to the success of these advertising campaigns.
Data Anlysis: I performed this analysis by manipulating the data set to extract the independant variable values for the number of dollars (in USD) spent on an ad, and the number of days the ad ran. I then performed a single regression analysis for each of these independent variables, and a multiple regression analysis for both variables. 
Findings: I found that neither variable had a strong correlation with the number of impressions.

Business Question: What independent factors contribute the most to the success of a snpachat political advertisement?
Data Question: What is the correlation between number of dollars spent/number of days run and number of impressions for a snapchat political advertisement?
Data Answer: Both independant variables had poor regression model outputs. Run length was determined to be a non-significant variable, and the number of dollars spent variable showed low R^2 and high standard error of regression.
Business Answer: Neither number of dollars nor number of days had a high correlation with the number of impressions. We must do more research into other metrics that may determine the amount of people who view a snapchat advertisement.
